# MLP-Database ([Website](https://sites.google.com/site/ntustmlpdatabase/home))

By Gee-Sern Hsu ; Si-De Zeng ; Chun-Wei Chiu ; Sheng-Luen Chung

The NTUST-MLP database contains 2120 images, of 640.x480 pixels in size each, collected from roadsides, parking lots and in-vehicle video recorders.

We hope that the Pulse from face (MLP) database could revolutionized the landscape of heart rate detection research. A detailed introduction of MLP can be found in the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7169772).

Here are some examples from the dataset.
